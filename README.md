# 3d

A collection of 3d-printable parts, created by IRLToolkit for the IRL community.

Each directory contains one 3d printable thing, which is designed for improving the life of IRL streamers. Images are included.

## Contributing

Got a print of your own that you'd like added to the collection? Make a PR with your stl's and include it as a directory. Feel free to take credit or link what you would like in the README.md of your print. All prints contained in this
repository follow the `Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal` license, aka public domain.

Do you have a suggestion on how to make a print better? Since suggesting changes to prints is not exactly a reasonable thing to do with PRs, feel free to open a new Issue and describe your suggested changes.
